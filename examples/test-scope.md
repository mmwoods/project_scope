## Important Notes

- Any pages not included in the above scope will be displayed as per our base eCommerce framework, with your branding/colours applied.
- When a mockup isn't included, we'll use our design expertise when it comes to the final look. If you have specific requirements regarding the aesthetic please let us know before work starts. Alternatively, we can include a billable mockup in the quote, which allows you to request changes to the design.
- Any functionality not outlined in the above scope, even if it is present on your existing site, any example sites you provided for inspiration, or mentioned in scoping discussions, will not be included as part of the quoted amount below, and may attract additional billable time.
- Unless specified, changes to the checkout page, print documents (e.g. invoices) or system emails (e.g. order confirmation) will not be included.
- Theme editor functionality is not available for custom designs.

The above work requires **68.5 hours** of design time, which comes to **$10,960** in total (ex.GST). All design projects that have been quoted over 10 hours of work have terms of 50% project due upfront and 50% invoiced after the declared milestone, which for this project is **Category Page: Product Thumbnail Design Deliverable*. Once received, we'll proceed with the next phase of the project.

Please note that this quote is purely for design; it doesn't cover monthly subscription fees or additional services.

## Deliverables

### Home Page Phase

The Home Page Phase is the basis of design for the whole project, therefore it is required to have these pages approved before commencing work on any remaining design deliverables.

We'll aim to get the first draft of the designs completed within the first week.

The design process is collaborative so once you see the first draft we welcome any feedback you may have and we'll collectively work towards having these deliverables approved by week 2.

- 1.1 - Home Page Design Deliverable (week 2)

### Additional Mockup Phase

This phase commences upon the completion of the **Home Page Phase**.

- 1.2 - Mobile Header & Menu Design Deliverable (week 3)
- 1.3 - Megamenu Design Deliverable (week 3)
- 1.4 - Product Page Design Deliverable (week 4)
- 1.5 - Quick View Design Deliverable (week 4)
- 1.6 - Category Page: Product Thumbnail Design Deliverable (week 4)

### Implementation Phase

Once you've approved all of the design deliverables, we'll move onto implementation. Once complete, we'll deliver the following:

- 2.1 - A link to the finished design, for you to browse and review. (week 8)
- 2.2 - Custom feature notes, to assist you in working with your new design. (week 8)

<!-- 
Total Mockup Hours: 26.25hr
Total Coding Hours: 42.25hr
- Home Page Implementation 23.5hr
- Category Page Implementation 2.75hr
- Product Page Implementation 8.75hr
- Product Thumbnails Implementation 7.25hr
- Review and Testing
-->

At the time of scoping your project requirements it will take **8 weeks** from initial payment to complete the project. This is subject to change if the project isnâ€™t accepted within a week of receiving the proposal to accommodate our existing projects.

After the implementation phase is complete, there tends to be a review period in the following weeks whereby you test the design to ensure that it works well with your data (products, categories, content, etc.) that is being pulled from your Neto control panel. Once this review is complete, your new design will be ready to go live.
